# The Vault

## Summary
Cleanse each of three plates three times by bringing a Taken Essence Orb with the proper buff to the plate. Kill Might of Rivens before they cause a team kill. 

## Preparation
Unlike many of the other encounters, there is no single boss in The Vault, so there is no real need to have any particular class combination. Supers that deal high damage in a short time might be helpful for the Might of Rivens and Eye of Rivens.

A shotgun like the Ikelos SG may be helpful for dealing with the powerful weapons, as would Sleeper Simulant. Encounters are mostly close-quarters, making Whisper of the Worm not at its best.

## Locations
Upon entering the encounter room, you’ll first see a large sphere in the center of the chamber. This is surrounded by three pressure plates built into the ground. Each plate is adjacent to a side chamber. One of them has a large rock in the center, another has a tree in its center, and the last has stairs descending to the center of the side chamber. They are commonly referred to as rock, tree (or forest), and stairs, respectively. Each of these side chambers has a tunnel that connects it to each of the other two side chambers.

The main chamber also has walls that occasionally rotate around the center of the room. These can’t kill you, but will sometimes get in your way.

## Starting the encounter
Three guardians stand on the three different plates.

## Phase 1

### Objective
Figure out how each plate needs to be cleansed in the next phase. 

### Mechanics
One or two plates will need to be cleansed by someone carrying a Taken Essence orb with the “Taken Essence Antumbra” buff (we’ll call it “antubmra”), while the other(s) will need to be cleansed by someone with the “Taken Essence Pentumbra” buff (“penumbra”). While each of the three plates has a guardian standing on it, each guardian on a plate will see a set of three different symbols on the spherical console in the center.

A possible set of symbols, as viewed from one of the plates

Guardians on the plates need to communicate among themselves to figure out which plates have matching symbols. 

This part is easiest explained as an example. You and two other guardians are standing on the plates, and you see the symbols shown in the picture above. One of the other guardians tells you that the middle symbol in the set of symbols they see looks like a dragon breathing fire to the left. You see that you also have that symbol--it’s the leftmost one in your set of three. This means that your plate needs to be cleansed by someone carrying a Taken Essence with the “penumbra” buff. If the dragon breathing fire to the left had instead been the rightmost symbol in your set of three, then your plate would need to be cleansed by someone with the “antumbra” buff. If you didn’t see that symbol at all, that would mean that the third guardian on the plate has the matching symbol in their set. 


The possible symbols and sample callouts.

If you are not on a plate, your responsibility is to eliminate the spawning creatures while the others do their job.

This phase ends when two of the side chambers become sealed off. Stay in the center chamber to avoid getting trapped in the chamber. If you do become trapped, take one of the tunnels to the room that remains unsealed. 

### Strategy
On PC, have someone dedicated to recording your results in fireteam chat. For example, if the plate at rock needs the antumbra buff, type “R A” in chat
You only need to figure out which buff is needed for two of the three plates. The last one can be inferred later.

## Phase 2

### Objective
Kill the Eye of Riven. Ensure only the designated runner gets sealed in the chamber.

### Mechanics
At the start of this phase, two of the three chambers have been sealed off. Three waves of creatures will spawn inside the unsealed chamber. Some creatures will spawn in the central chamber as well. The final wave will also spawn an Eye of Riven in the unsealed chamber, who will drop a Taken Essence Orb on its death. 

This phase ends when a guardian picks up the Taken Essence Orb. When they do, the currently unsealed chamber will become sealed off, and one of the other two chambers will become unsealed.

### Strategy
Designate a guardian to pick up the Taken Essence Orb. All other guardians should evacuate the unsealed chamber before the orb is picked up and the chamber closes off.

## Phase 3

### Objective
Use the Taken Essence Orb to cleanse one of the pressure plates. Kill the Might(s) of Riven before they wipe the fireteam.

### Mechanics
All guardians but the one who picked up the Taken Essence Orb first should communicate to the orb runner which room has become unsealed. Then, they need to be looking out for the Might of Riven. They will spawn in one of the side chambers, whether or not it is sealed (they can walk through the sealed wall). They will move towards the nearest pressure plate and thrust their sword in it. A few seconds after this occurs, if the Might of Riven is still alive, all guardians will die. Don’t let that happen. Kill it dead. Other creatures will be spawning during this time as well. Kill them dead too.

The guardian with the Orb needs to listen to their teammates to learn which of the rooms has become unsealed. There are two tunnels in each of the side chambers, and each one leads to one of the other chambers. They need to take the proper one to get to the unsealed room. There will be two Taken Phalanx in the tunnel, as well as creatures in the unsealed room. The orb runner needs to look at which buff they have--antumbra or pentumbra--and bring their orb to a plate that needs to be cleansed with that buff.

Once they are standing on that plate, they press their grenade button while holding the orb to cleanse it. If they correctly matched the buff to the plate, the pillar of dark energy over the plate will disappear. Otherwise, the guardian will die. The number next to the antumbra or penumbra will also increase over time while holding the orb. If your buff reaches 10 stacks, you die. 

### Strategy
The guardian with the orb should shoot the Taken Phalanx in the tunnel with the orb’s primary fire. Otherwise, the Phalanx may launch them against a wall and kill them.
Have at least one guardian assigned to look for and kill a Might of Riven at each plate. 
Establish a way to communicate with your team about which tunnel the guardian with the orb needs to take. Either establish a point of reference and use left and right, or have the guardian with the orb memorize which tunnels lead to which side chamber, then just say which chamber is open.

## The Rest of the Encounter

### Objective
Cleanse the remaining two plates, then repeat the whole process two more times.

### Mechanics
After cleansing the first plate, guardians need to repeat phases 2 and 3 for the remaining 2 uncleansed plates. The only difference is that there will be more Knight of Rivens: two on the 2nd iteration, and three on the third. While completing these phases, a four minute timer called Vault Security Mechanism will appear in the bottom-left. When it reaches zero, you die. The timer resets once the third plate has been cleansed. 

After all 3 plates have been cleansed, repeat phases 1-3 two more times. They behave exactly the same as the first time. After the final plate is cleansed, the encounter is complete. Onwards to Riven!

### Strategy
The antumbra and penumbra buffs are not removed immediately after cleansing a plate, so avoid having the same guardian carry the orb for two plates in a row. 
After the Encounter
After you’ve secured your loot, continue through the large double doors in the main chamber, and follow the long hallway, taking a right at its end. There isn’t a raid chest between this encounter and the next one. Next, prepare yourself for Last Wish’s most challenging encounter: Riven of a Thousand Voices.
